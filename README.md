# spotify-recommendation-generator

The spotify API grants access to a ton of unique song information. My "liked songs" playlist on spotify contains thousands of songs I have added since my account was created in 2016-2017. I want to use the information from my liked songs list to generate smaller playlists based on certain criterea. I will do so with machine learning algoriths and an interactive web app so any user can input a playlist and create a smaller playlist from that playlist given certain song criterea.
